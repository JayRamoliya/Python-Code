# Recursion in python
# In Python, we know that a function can call other functions. It is even possible for the function to call itself. These types of construct are termed as recursive functions.

# factorial(7) = 7*6*5*4*3*2*1
# factorial(6) = 6*5*4*3*2*1
# factorial(5) = 5*4*3*2*1
# factorial(4) = 4*3*2*1
# factorial(0) = 1
# factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)
