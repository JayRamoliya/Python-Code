# SET IN PYTHON
# Sets are unordered collection of data items. 
# They store multiple items in a single variable. 
# Set items are separated by commas and enclosed within curly brackets {}. Sets are unchangeable, meaning you cannot change items of the set once created. 
# Sets do not contain duplicate items.

info = {"Carla", 19, False, 5.9, 19}
print(info)

# Quick Quiz: Try to create an empty set. Check using the type() function whether the type of your variable is a set
